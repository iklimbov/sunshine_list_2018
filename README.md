Analysis of Ontario Sunshine List 2018

Data sources:
1.  Public sector salary disclosure data sets (2008-2018)
2.  indeed.com ratings

The purpose of this project was to analyses the gender balance of the Sunshine List published by Ontario government and to resume pay inequality between male and female employees.

I also tried to find co-relation between equality in the organizations and culture, which was measured based on indeed.com company ratings.

This project consists of three main Jupyter notebooks and several datasets:

        scraping_indeed.ipynb contains code for scraping and cleaning indeed.com data for the list of companies.

        data_building.ipynb is the code for cleaning, merging, generating data to get it ready for analysis

        analysis.ipynb is mostly graphs and simple analytics performed on the data.
        
Data files are in the ./data directory, they are just sample files, as the originals seem to be too large to include into the project
